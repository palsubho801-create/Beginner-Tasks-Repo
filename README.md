# Beginner Tasks Repository

Welcome to the Beginner Tasks Repository! This is a beginner-friendly project designed for [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) participants who want to make their first open-source contributions.

## About This Project

This repository contains simple C programs that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts. It's an excellent starting point for beginners to learn Git, GitHub workflows, and open-source contribution practices.

### What's Inside?

The repository includes the following C programs:

- [`area_circle.c`](area_circle.c) - Calculates the area of a circle given its radius
- [`bubble_sort.c`](bubble_sort.c) - Implements the bubble sort algorithm
- [`factorial.c`](factorial.c) - Computes the factorial of a number
- [`linear_search.c`](linear_search.c) - Performs a linear search on an array
- [`max_of_two.c`](max_of_two.c) - Finds the maximum of two numbers
- [`reverse_string.c`](reverse_string.c) - Reverses a given string
- [`simple_interest.c`](simple_interest.c) - Calculates simple interest
- [`temp_convert.c`](temp_convert.c) - Converts temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine
3. Explore the C programs and try running them
4. Make improvements or add new features
5. Submit your changes via a Pull Request

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.)
- Basic understanding of Git and GitHub
- Text editor or IDE for C programming

### Running the Programs

To compile and run any of the C programs, use the following commands:

```bash
gcc program_name.c -o program_name
./program_name
```

Replace `program_name` with the actual name of the program you want to run.
